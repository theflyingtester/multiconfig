if an authorized_keys file gets clobbered or mis-permissioned, I need to log into the remote terminal to fix it
 The actual user gets sudo access via an arbitrarily long password and 
 log in is done with public keys, not passwords.
 Administration is as simple as keeping the authorized_keys file up-to-date across servers. 
 Root login over ssh is disabled, 
 and the actual user can only log in from a defined IP (block).

//Todo: try the IP with VPN etc to make sure gaps are seen before disconnecting any direct terminal

Start here:

Determine which user id you need on your server/client 

I have a monkey.

passwd monkey
//also for root and others :-)
